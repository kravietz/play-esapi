play-esapi
==========
This simple [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) application is intentionally vulnerable and bypasses
Play's built-in security mechanisms to serve as a playground for security testing. Some of the vulnerable methods
are protected using OWASP ESAPI - see tutorial: [Using ESAPI with Play Framework](http://ipsec.pl/2014/using-esapi-play-framework.html)
